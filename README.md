# -Concurrency-of-Database-in-C
 Concurrency of Database, developed using POSIX library in ​C, to design and implement a concurrent access library operating on a warehouse database. The concurrent library receives requests from client threads and forwards this request onto the ​products database interface that allows users to create, update,modify,delete and other access operations on product details of the database. The POSIX library functions were used to achieve​ synchronization without losing the consistency of data and act as a wrapper of the database interface.
